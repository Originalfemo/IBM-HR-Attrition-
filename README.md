# IBM-HR-Attrition-
This analysis was based on a fictional dataset about IBM's attrition rate. This analysis was carried out using Power BI.

The analysis looks majorly into reasons for attrition and the group within which those affected fall into.
From the analysis, it shows that those with a higher monthly income, those who live closer to work, those who do not work overtime, those who have been at the company for more than 2 years, etc., are less likely to be affected.
